The Division of Building Standards and Codes does not certify the accuracy of figures provided.  Reports are not provided for all local governments each year.  Prior to 2018, local governments that performed code enforcement activities for other local governments sometimes reported activities for multiple jurisdictions in a single report associated with a single jurisdiction.  For example, a county might have included figures for towns and villages for which it administered the Uniform Code.  Local governments may submit revised reports.  When the Division receives a revised report, it marks the first submission replaced.  The listing only displays the most current submission provided by the local government.  Prior to 2018, multiple reports were received from some local governments with incomplete information.  Generally, this would happen when one department, such as a fire department, was responsible for annual fire safety inspections and another, such as a building department, was responsible for other code enforcement activity.  From 2016 to 2017, online reports included questions specifically addressed to which functions the report covered.  Prior to 2016, this coverage was imputed algorithmically or manually based on which portions of the report form were completed.  From 2018 forward, each local government is required to file a single report for all Uniform Code administration activities in its jurisdiction."}]},"metadata":{"domain":"data.ny.gov"},"permalink":"https://data.ny.gov/d/kpkx-452i","link":"https://data.ny.gov/Government-Finance/Uniform-Code-Annual-Report-Submissions-Beginning-2/kpkx-452i","owner":{"id":"xzik-pf59","user_type":"interactive","display_name":"NY Open Data"},"creator":{"id":"xzik-pf59","user_type":"interactive","display_name":"NY Open Data"}}}}

What other NYSERDA or energy-related datasets would you like to see on Open NY? Let us know by emailing OpenNY@nyserda.ny.gov.\n\nThis is part 1 (contains: Behavior and Demographics; Building Shell; Kitchen Appliances; and Heating and Cooling) of 2; part 2 (https://data.ny.gov/d/87mp-9bnv) contains: Clothes Washing and Drying; Water Heating; Home Lighting; Pool and Spa; Small Household Appliances; and Miscellaneous Equipment.  The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), in collaboration with the New York State Department of Public Service (DPS), conducted a statewide residential baseline study (study) from 2011 to 2014 of the single-family and multifamily residential housing segments, including new construction, and a broad range of energy uses and efficiency measures. This dataset includes 2,982 single-family and 379 multifamily occupant survey completes for a total of 3,361 responses. The survey involved 2,285 Web, 1,041 telephone, and 35 mini-inspection surveys. The survey collected information on the following building characteristics: building shell, kitchen appliances, heating and cooling equipment, water heating equipment, clothes washing and drying equipment, lighting, pool and spa equipment, small household appliances, miscellaneous energy consuming equipment, as well as behaviors and characteristics of respondents.","publisher":"NY Open Data","landing_url":"https://data.ny.gov/d/3m6x-h3qa","soda_url":"https://data.ny.gov/resource/3m6x-h3qa.json","categories":["economy","environment","health","Energy & Environment"],"tags":["rsbl study","market characterization","energy efficiency","baseline study","single-family homes"],"updated_at":"2019-11-15T21:47:19.000Z","created_at":"2015-06-23T17:20:50.000Z","provenance":{"discovery_queries":["pool inspections","pool inspection","spa inspection","public pool inspection","pool health inspection"],"discovery_fetched_at":"2026-01-19T14:34:16.009Z","raw_result":{"resource":{"name":"RSBS SMO: Part 1 of 2, New York State Residential Statewide Baseline Study: Single and Multifamily Occupant Telephone or Web Survey","id":"3m6x-h3qa","resource_name":null,"parent_fxf":[],"description":"How does your organization use this dataset?

The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years.\n\nThe survey was administered during the winter of 2021 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online.
